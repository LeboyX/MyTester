=head1 Description

Originally, I graded student code submissions used an often last-minute-patched
version of this module that, while very useful, sometimes proved too laborious
due to its inflexibility and lack of foresight during the initial design. 

This module (and all others contained w/in it) aims to make that proces easier
providing generic, easily extended and re-used tests, wrappers, and methods
of parallelisation to make grading code submissions easier/faster/cleaner. This
module does not leverage the TAP interface of any of the Test::* modules. It's
all written from scratch. 

While this module is I<intended> for testing/grading code submissions, there
is no restriction on what you can do. If written properly, it should be 
applicable to most testing circumstances in one form or another.
